<p>
	

<div>Throughout my life, I felt various emotions and wished to express myself, yet it was difficult for me to write about my thoughts and share them </div>
<div>with others. As I grew up, I learned about how people were able to use a unique method to tell stories and convey messages without words or writing: art.</div> 
<div>In my perspective, art is a significant form of expression and communication. That is why I decided to become an artist and use art as a way </div>
<div>for me to use my imagination and express my ideas. I am interested in drawing, designing, editing, animating, advertising, and creating websites. </div>
<div>I like basing my artwork on fictional characters and objects, places I have traveled to and real world objects. Through my art, I can be myself and </div>
		<div>allow my imagination to come to life.</div>

	</p>

As I watched numerous animations and learned more about the meaning of art, I became inspired by the animator known as Walt Disney. He inspired me to 
believe that hard work and dedication to my passion will allow my dreams to come true. I will use my art to express my creativity and make people feel 
happy. Since art is an essential factor to my life, my dream is to someday become an artist for Disney. I believe that if I work hard, stay positive and 
never give up even when I face obstacles, I will achieve success.

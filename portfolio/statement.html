<h1 style="color:white;">Artist Statement</h1>

<p style="color:white;">Throughout my life, I felt various emotions and wished to express myself, yet it was difficult for me to write about my thoughts and share them with others. As I grew up, I learned about how people were able to use a unique method to tell stories and convey messages without words or writing: art. In my perspective, art is a significant form of expression and communication. That is why I decided to become an artist and use art as a way for me to use my imagination and express my ideas. I am interested in various ways of producing art such as photography, drawing, designing, editing, animating, advertising, and creating websites. I like basing my artwork on fictional characters, people, animals, places I have traveled to and real world objects. Through my art, I can be myself and allow my imagination to come to life. 
</p>

<p1 style="color:white;">As I travel the world, I visit places, view scenes and see objects that help inspire my art. I continue exploring to learn more about who I am as an artist and think more about ways to convey messages through art and express myself. I use my art to capture objects, animals, scenery and faces I see in the real world and work with them through my various ways of producing art.</p1>

	<p>In this pencil drawing, the objects contain features that are circular and have various shades of colors.
This piece of art shows how shades of color, lighting and the form of shapes may vary at different angles even though
these objects are still.</p>

<p>This facet art was created in Adobe Illustrator with a feature called the pen tool, a tool 
		that allows artists to create drawings in their computers. This facet consists of 
		colorful, triangular shapes combined together to form one piece of digital art.
		The composition of these shapes make this facet appear abstract.

<p>This net art was generated through codes typed into a text editor known as Atom. This sketch is an animated
butterfly that moves and changes color as the user clicks on it. This is an example of how people can use
codes to use their imagination and develop ways to create interactive animations.</p>

This type of art is known as a facet art which is art involves multiple shapes combined together to form a piece of art such as 
a person, animal or character. This facet was created in Adobe Illustrator with a feature called the pen tool, a tool that allows 
artists to create drawings in their computers. It consists of colorful, triangular shapes combined together to form 
one piece of abstract digital art.</p>

In this pencil drawing, the objects contain features that are circular and have various shades of colors.
This piece of art shows how shades of color, lighting and the form of 
shapes may vary at different angles even though
these objects are still.</p>	<img src="Drawing.jpg" width="365" height="353">

		This pixel art was created with a code typed in a computer program known as Processing. The method of 
		using codes to create art shows how artists are able to provide instructions for a computer to process 
		information that can be used to produce animation.</p>

	<p>This type of art is known as a poly art which is artwork that involves multiple polygons and triangles
	drawn on a computer and combined together to form one piece. This poly art was created in Illustrator and
	combined with a background image of a city in Photoshop. This is an example of how artists can create digital
	drawings with Illustrator.</p>

	<p>This pixel art of me was created after I used processing to type in code that allowed me to animate
	pictures I uploaded. This demonstrates how codes may be used to animate pictures of living beings such
	as people. Artists may use photography to capture beautiful objects, people or places they see in the real world and 
	use processing to transform them into animations.</p>

<p>This net art was generated a code typed into a text editor known as Atom. This sketch is an animated
butterfly that moves and changes color as the user clicks on it. This is an example of how people can use
codes to use their imagination and develop ways to create interactive animations.</p>
